<h1>Matt's Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>A top 3 list</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Commando</h3>
<p>An absolute master class of 80's action films with it's fair share of one-liners, shoot outs, fights and explosions. For campy action fun it doesn't get much better than this</p>
<h3>Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>I'm going to cheat and put a trilogy here because these movies encompass what it means to be one of the best if not THE best book to movie adapations ever released.</p>
<h3>John Wick (series)</h3>
<p>I'm a dirty cheater again because I want to use another series but I can't help it. The John Wick films are the best action films to show up in modern times. Arguably, considering the utter garbage that has been coming out as of late. I would argue they're some of the best movies to be relased in recent times full stop.</p>
